# Project Title

This project is to make a game bot for the intra-college hackathon 'Hacknite'.
We made a text based choose your own adventure game bot.
## Track and Contributors
Our track is Discord-Bot and the contributers are Ananya Vundavalli (IMT2023537) and Pragya Rai (IMT2023529).
## Problem Statement
We need to make an arcade themed bot.
## Goal
Our goal was to make a choose your own adventure type game bot.
## Features
The game bot has commands which you can use to continue the story.It is a single player game. There are some areas which have riddles with time-limits while other places have particular games like rearranging letters and a rescue game where you have to save a person from drowning.
There is also a game with a battle.
## Tech Stack
We used python and discord.py in VS code.
## How to run
Link to invite bot: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1224387632306323567&permissions=8&scope=bot
After inviting a bot to start with the instructions, enter: /start_game .
The commands to choose and continue the story will be given in the messages sent by the bot.
## Deployment (if done)
None
## Applications of your idea
The bot can be used to increase engagement in your server. It is a great way to be entertainment, alleviating boredom.
## Further improvements
Improvements that can be done are taking care of how the purge function is used as the number of messages to be deleted is hard-coded. Another is to expand the storyline and add more games in between. Also, hosting in cloud could be done.
